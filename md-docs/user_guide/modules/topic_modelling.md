## What is Topic Modeling?

Topic modeling is a machine learning technique used to uncover hidden topics within a large collection of documents. It is based on the idea that each document is a combination of topics, where a topic is a probability distribution over words. Thus, topic modeling helps us extract patterns in word usage that reflect semantic concepts within a document collection.

### Key Applications

- **Document Classification and Retrieval**: Improving search functionality by categorizing a vast array of documents—such as news articles, legal records, and publications—based on specific topics, making it easier for users to locate relevant information.

- **Trend Analysis**: Tracking shifts in popular topics over time, whether in sports, entertainment, or legal affairs, to identify emerging trends, patterns, or changes in public interest.

- **Content Personalization and Recommendations**: Delivering tailored content suggestions by aligning topic distributions with user preferences, enhancing reader engagement in media, and providing relevant updates in legal research or news.

- **Sentiment and Public Opinion Analysis**: Analyzing reader feedback, comments, or social media mentions to understand public sentiment on current events, legal issues, or sports outcomes, supporting editorial and policy decisions.

- **Automated Summarization and Archival**: Summarizing and tagging vast collections of historical data for easy retrieval and archival, especially beneficial for large publishing and legal databases.

- **Regulatory and Compliance Monitoring**: Assisting legal teams by organizing regulations and case precedents based on topics, aiding compliance checks and quick reference to relevant laws or guidelines.

- **Cross-Departmental Collaboration**: Identifying overlapping topics of interest between departments, such as marketing and editorial, to streamline content strategies or align on thematic trends across the organization.

## Defining a Topic

A **topic** is a distinct semantic concept representing a probability distribution over a set of words. This distribution suggests which words are most representative of the topic.
!!! example
    In a dataset of news articles, a topic about "sports" might have a high probability for words like "team," "game," "win," and "player," as these words are central to the concept of sports. While terms such as "economy," "politics," or "technology," would have lower probabilities within this topic, as they are related to different domains.

Formally, the probabilistic distribution of a topic \( k \) over a vocabulary of words \( w \) is denoted as:
$$
  \beta_k = \{P(w | k)\}_{w \in V}
$$

where:

- \( V \) is the size of the vocabulary.
- \( P(w_i \mid k) \) is the probability of word \( w_i \) for the topic \( k \).

Similarly, each document \( d \) is represented as a distribution over topics \( \theta_d \):

\[
\theta_d = \left\{ P(k \mid d) \right\}_{k=1}^K
\]

where:

- \( K \) is the total number of topics.
- \( P(k \mid d) \) is the probability of topic \( k \) in document \( d \).

## Clustering vs. Topic Modeling

Clustering and topic modeling are both techniques used to analyze and organize data, but they serve distinct purposes. 

- **Clustering**: groups documents into mutually exclusive clusters, assigning each document to a single category based on similarity, making it ideal for applications needing clear-cut groups like customer segmentation. 
- **Topic modeling**: identifies latent themes within a document collection, allowing each document to be associated with multiple topics in varying proportions. This approach is especially useful for complex text analysis where documents often span multiple themes, such as news or research articles.
